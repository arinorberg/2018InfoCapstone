							<h2>Key Features</h2>

							<h3>Access Database</h3>
							<p>Our data management system was built using Microsoft Access. The relational database organizes and stores SightLife's data in a controlled and centralized location. Data types and general formatting is enforced in order to maintain good data integrity. Most of all, in building a normalized database, we allow SightLife to easily query their data in meaningful and impactful ways. Our database saves SightLife time building and keeping track of Excel sheets, as well as time analyzing and manually asking questions of their data. Having everything stored in one place, where queries can be easily built and run, allows SightLife the time and focus needed to sooner eliminate corneal blindness worldwide. Our team developed numerous queries in Access, to be imported in Power BI to easily create dashboards and visualizations answering pertinent questions.</p>

							<h3>Access Forms</h3>
							<p>Our Forms, also built in Microsoft Access directly solve the issues SightLife faced surrounding data insertion and accuracy. The forms are used for data-entry into the database, in which users enter data through this user-friendly interface instead of directly touching the tables. The forms are dynamic, in which the various dropdowns and lists change depending on previous inputs. They also allows improve control and can check for errors or restricted data, to make sure users are inputting all of the necessary and correct data. Overall, this improved the quality of SightLife’s data and makes their data handling processes more efficient, simple and standardized.<p>

							<h3>Power BI Visualizations</h3>
							<p>Our visualizations, combined with queries built in the Access database, provide valuable answers to questions SightLife had about their data. Previously, answering these questions would have taken a lot of manual and complex analysis, which was not feasibly for SightLife to perform. Our services allow SightLife to seamlessly and recurrently ask questions of their data and get accurate responses fast. The most important questions SightLife wanted answers to were year over year growth in surgical volumes, NPS (Net Promotors Scores) for their training courses, and the count for number of surgeons trained. Other valuable answers SightLife wanted were which classes have highest and lowest year over year growth for alumni, percent breakdown of participants by institution type, what surgeons are doing more surgeries post course than pre course, as well as more questions about comparisons of scores/surgeries, counts, minimum/maximum scores, etc. Through the use of Microsoft’s Power BI Visualization software, we were able to build multiple dashboards that allow SightLife to answer these questions, as well be able to explore and analyze their data to gain new insights.</p>
