								<h2>Problem</h2>
								<p>The multifaceted nature of SightLife’s programs, and dependence on collaboration amongst remote teams, requires strong reporting systems. SightLife has an incredibly significant mission to fulfill - to bring sight to the millions of people around the world who are affected by corneal blindness. Achieving this mission and working towards eliminating corneal blindness altogether requires great focus, commitment, and dedication that should not be hindered by lack of streamlined information systems.</p>
								<p>Before the delivery of our team’s project, SightLife collected much of their data in poorly organized Excel spreadsheets. After information was collected from a new surgical training course, users would have to manually input the data directly into a master excel sheet. This was a tedious process that left a lot of room for errors and poor data integrity. Analyzing and reporting on the data was also a manual process that was limited by the functionalities of Excel pivot tables and basic visualizations. This system is not able to scale with SightLife’s continuing growth and the nature of the way the data is stored and analyzed meant there was a lot of unanswered questions and untapped insight regarding Sightlife's data.</p>
								<p>The potential of Sightlife's data was not being realized, inhibiting Sightlife from fully unleashing their own potential as a global health organization. We assisted SightLife in solving their problems surrounding their data management systems and processes. We made data improved the effectiveness and efficiency of their data-entry, data storage and data analytics, as well as streamlined their ability to explore and understand their data, so that they could improve their programs and communicate project status and key metrics with their stakeholders.</p>
