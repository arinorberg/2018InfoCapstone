								<h2>Problem</h2>
								<p>The multifaceted nature of SightLife’s programs, and dependence on collaboration amongst remote teams, requires strong reporting systems. SightLife has an incredibly significant mission to fulfill - to bring sight to the millions of people around the world who struggle to live with corneal blindness. Achieving this mission and working towards eliminating corneal blindness altogether requires great focus, commitment, and dedication that should not be hindered by lack of streamlined technology systems.</p>
								<p>Before the delivery of our team’s project, SightLife collected much of their data in poorly organized Excel spreadsheets, with a lot of data being manually entered. Surgeons would enter data directly into a master excel sheet, which gave opportunity for other people's records to be accidently altered or even removed. Data trends were being communicated by email, with little analysis being done. During entry, data was frequently misinserted, misformatted, or even lost. Simple visualizations of data were created through Excel, with many questions left unanswered from Sightlife's data.</p>
								<p>The potential of Sightlife's data was not being realized, inhibiting Sightlife from fully unleashing their own potential as a global health organization. We assisted SightLife in solving their problems surrounding collecting and storing their data accurately, as well as communicating project status and key metrics within their teams in a streamlined fashion.</p>
