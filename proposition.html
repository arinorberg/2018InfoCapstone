								<h2>The Proposition</h2>
								<p>In proposing our project, our team made sure we could not only improve, but solves Sightlifeâ€™s major data issues. We wanted to provide SightLife with services to help them streamline data entry, reduce errors, and understand their data more dynamically.</p>
								<p>Our team's ability to provide SightLife with a data management system was constrained by SightLife needing something simple, inexpensive, and easy to maintain without the hiring of a database administrator. SightLife needed to make sure that our tools would be user-friendly, so that those who are not the most tech-savvy could easily use our services.</p>
								<p>For our project, we designed a data management system, in the form of an easily maintainable and user-friendly Access Database joint with powerful Power BI queries/visualizations. We chose to use Access because SightLife already had it included in their Microsoft subscription, so this wouldn't cost them anything to use and maintain (unlike other popular database management platforms, which require separate subscriptions). Similarly, SightLife already had access to Power BI. We had originally wanted to use Tableau, but realized that having SightLife acquire a Tableau subscription was costly and not as feasibly. Our team realized that Power BI was just, if not more, useful and effective for powerfully communicating knowledge and trends from SightLife's data in the Access database.</p>
								<h2>Success Criteria</h2>
								<p>The project will have achieved its goals when the following are completed:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Create a standardized data collection, data insertion and formatting process (e.g. fields, data types, etc.)</li>
									<li>Generation of data visualizations is streamlined and improved interpretability</li>
									<li>Human error and data handling time is minimized</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Our plan for completing each of these success criteria was as follows:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Design and build a well-organized/normalized database in Access</li>
									<li>Build forms in Access that can be easily used to accurately and efficiently insert data into the database, maintaining the integrity of SightLife's data</li>
									<li>Build queries in Access, that can be connected to visualizations in Power BI</li>
									<li>Build visualizations and dashboards in Power BI that not only answer SightLife's various questions about their data, but also provide deeper insight</li>
								</ul>
